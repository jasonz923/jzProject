The steps I followed after creating my account and public repository were:
1.  I clicked "Clone or download" and copied the link provided
2.  In my Linux machine I entered "git clone <thelink I copied>"
3.  I created 2 html files in my linux machine in the newly formed repository directory
4.  I entered "git add .", "git commit -m "Add new files"", "git push origin master"
5.  I then entered my account information to confirm the commit
